  \en-abstract{
%	The smart city is one of the most important applications of the Internet of Things (IoT) that has recently been considered by researchers. In the smart city, the goal is for all available devices to be able to connect to the Internet, so that all information exchange takes place within the network.
%	The information generated by these devices first needs to be processed and analyzed. Therefore, this information must be sent to the processing resources and the result of the processing must be returned to the relevant devices in the form of decisions.
